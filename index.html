    <h1><strong> The Chameleon </strong></h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Chameleons are a family, <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamaeleonidae">Chamaeleonidae</a> , of small scaly sauropsids (reptiles). <br>
         There are about 161 species of <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamaeleonidae">chameleons</a> , most of them in Africa south of the Sahara. <br> 
         In America, lizards of the anole family, which bear no special relationship to true <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamaeleonidae">chameleons</a> , are often called chameleons. <br> 
         They are famous for their ability to change color depending on the circumstances, for their fast and elongated tongue, and for their eyes, which can be moved independently of each other.

    <h2>This is a chameleon</h2>

    <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
    <p>Chameleons vary greatly in size, from the small chameleons of the Brookesia family which are 2.9 cm long Brookesia micra to the large 80 cm Calumna parsonii. <br>
        The smallest species that lives on the island of Nosy-bé in Madagascar is Brookesia minima and in its adult phase it hardly exceeds a centimeter and a half. <br>
        Many of them have ornaments on their heads or faces such as nasal protuberances and even horns as in the case of Trioceros jacksonii or long crests on the top of their heads as Chamaeleo calyptratus. <br>
        Many species are sexually dimorphic and males are often more ornate than their female counterparts.
